# Exercise: Write a Hello GPU Kernel

The 01-hello-gpu.cu (*<---- click on the link of the source file to open it in another tab for editing*) contains a program that is already working. It contains two functions, both with print "Hello from the CPU" messages. Your goal is to refactor the helloGPU function in the source file so that it actually runs on the GPU, and prints a message indicating that it does.

- Refactor the application, before compiling and running it with the nvcc command just below (remember, you can execute the contents of the code execution cell by CTRL + ENTER it). The comments in 01-hello-gpu.cu will assist your work. If you get stuck, or want to check your work, refer to the solution. Don't forget to save your changes to the file before compiling and running with the command below.
