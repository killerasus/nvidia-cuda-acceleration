Exercise: Accelerating a For Loop with a Mismatched Execution Configuration

The program in 02-mismatched-config-loop.cu allocates memory, using cudaMallocManaged for a 1000 element array of integers, and then seeks to initialize all the values of the array in parallel using a CUDA kernel. This program assumes that both N and the number of threads_per_block are known. Your task is to complete the following two objectives, refer to the solution if you get stuck:

    Assign a value to number_of_blocks that will make sure there are at least as many threads as there are elements in a to work on.
    Update the initializeElementsTo kernel to make sure that it does not attempt to work on data elements that are out of range.
