Exercise: Accelerating a For Loop with Multiple Blocks of Threads

Currently, the loop function inside 02-multi-block-loop.cu runs a for loop that will serially print the numbers 0 through 9. Refactor the loop function to be a CUDA kernel which will launch to execute N iterations in parallel. After successfully refactoring, the numbers 0 through 9 should still be printed. For this exercise, as an additional constraint, use an execution configuration that launches at least 2 blocks of threads. Refer to the solution if you get stuck.
