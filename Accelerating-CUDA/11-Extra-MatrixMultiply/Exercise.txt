Exercise: Accelerate 2D Matrix Multiply Application

The file 01-matrix-multiply-2d.cu contains a host function matrixMulCPU which is fully functional. Your task is to build out the matrixMulGPU CUDA kernel. The source code will execute the matrix multiplication with both functions, and compare their answers to verify the correctness of the CUDA kernel you will be writing. Use the following guidelines to support your work and refer to the solution if you get stuck:

    You will need to create an execution configuration whose arguments are both dim3 values with the x and y dimensions set to greater than 1.
    Inside the body of the kernel, you will need to establish the running thread's unique index within the grid per usual, but you should establish two indices for the thread: one for the x axis of the grid, and one for the y axis of the grid.
